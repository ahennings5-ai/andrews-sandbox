# Marathon Strength Training Program
## Research-Backed Program for Andrew Hennings

*Compiled from peer-reviewed research: Feb 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Strength training improves **running economy by 4-5%** and **time to exhaustion by up to 21%** — even in elite runners. The key is heavy, compound movements with explosive intent, not light circuit training.

---

## Research Highlights

### 1. The Støren Study (2008) — Heavy Squats Work
- **Protocol**: 4 sets × 4 reps half-squats at near-max weight, 3x/week
- **Results**: 5% improvement in running economy, 21% improvement in time to exhaustion
- **Mechanism**: Increased rate of force development = more efficient stride

### 2. Australian Institute of Sport (Saunders) — Even Elites Benefit
- Elite runners (sub-8:30 3k times) improved 4% in running economy
- Protocol: 3x/week gym + outdoor plyometrics

### 3. Concurrent Training Meta-Analysis (PMC9518107)
- Running-specific strength + endurance training = best of both worlds
- **Critical**: Perform on non-consecutive days to avoid interference
- **Separate sessions by 6+ hours** if same day

### 4. Glute Research (Collings et al., 2023)
**Tier 1 Exercises for Glute Max (highest force production):**
- Loaded split squat (495-688 N)
- Single-leg RDL (500-655 N)
- Single-leg hip thrust (505-640 N)

**Tier 1 Exercises for Glute Med (hip stability):**
- Side plank (338-483 N)
- Loaded single-leg squat (278-422 N)
- Single-leg RDL (283-405 N)

### 5. NYC Marathon Injury Prevention Study
- 12-week hip abductor & quad strengthening reduced overuse injuries
- Focus on single-leg stability exercises

## The Program

### Philosophy
- **Heavy compound movements** (not light circuits)
- **Single-leg emphasis** (running is a single-leg sport)
- **Explosive intent** (even with heavy weight, move with speed)
- **Progressive overload** → **Maintenance** → **Taper**

### Weekly Structure

| Day | Running | Strength |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **Mon** | Easy 3-4 mi | **Session A: Lower Power** |
| **Tue** | Rest/Cross-train | **Session B: Upper + Core** |
| **Wed** | Quality (tempo/intervals) | — |
| **Thu** | Easy 3-4 mi | **Session A or C (optional)** |
| **Fri** | Rest | — |
| **Sat** | Long Run | — |
| **Sun** | Rest | — |

**Rules:**
- Never lift heavy the day before long run or speed work
- Strength after easy runs (same day OK if 6+ hours apart)
- 2x/week minimum, 3x/week during base building

---

### Session A: Lower Power (30-40 min)

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Load | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|------|-------|
| **Barbell Back Squat** | 4 × 5 | Heavy (RPE 8) | 3 min | Full depth, explosive up |
| **Romanian Deadlift** | 3 × 8 | Moderate-heavy | 2 min | Hinge pattern, hamstrings |
| **Bulgarian Split Squat** | 3 × 8 each | DB or BB | 90 sec | Single-leg king |
| **Single-Leg Hip Thrust** | 3 × 10 each | BW or plate | 60 sec | Glute max activation |
| **Calf Raises** | 3 × 15 | Slow, loaded | 60 sec | Full ROM, pause at top |

**Progression:**
- Weeks 1-4: Build to working weight
- Weeks 5-12: Progressive overload (+2.5-5 lbs when all reps hit)
- Week 13+: Maintain weight, reduce volume

---

### Session B: Upper + Core (25-35 min)

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Load | Rest | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------|------|-------|
| **Cable Row** | 3 × 10 | Moderate | 90 sec | Posture muscles, squeeze |
| **DB Bench Press** | 3 × 10 | Moderate | 90 sec | Chest, arm drive |
| **Lat Pulldown** | 3 × 10 | Moderate | 90 sec | Back strength |
| **Pallof Press** | 3 × 10 each | Cable | 60 sec | Anti-rotation core |
| **Side Plank** | 3 × 30 sec each | BW | 30 sec | Glute med + obliques |
| **Dead Bug** | 3 × 10 each | BW | 30 sec | Core stability |

---

### Session C: Power + Plyometrics (Optional — 20 min)

*Add during base phase for explosive development*

| Exercise | Sets × Reps | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Box Jumps** | 4 × 5 | Step down, reset |
| **Bounding** | 4 × 20m | Exaggerated strides |
| **Single-Leg Hops** | 3 × 8 each | Stick landing |
| **Medicine Ball Slams** | 3 × 10 | Core power |
| **A-Skips** | 3 × 30m | Running-specific |

## Periodization by Phase

### Base Building (Feb - June): BUILD STRENGTH
- **Frequency**: 3x/week (A, B, C)
- **Intensity**: Progressive overload, RPE 7-8
- **Volume**: Full sets/reps
- **Goal**: Build strength foundation

### Marathon Training (July - Sept): MAINTAIN
- **Frequency**: 2x/week (A, B)
- **Intensity**: Same weight as peak base phase
- **Volume**: Reduce to 3 sets (from 4)
- **Goal**: Maintain without adding fatigue

### Peak Training (Oct 1-14): REDUCE
- **Frequency**: 2x/week
- **Intensity**: 80-85% of base phase weights
- **Volume**: 2 sets only
- **Goal**: Stay activated, don't accumulate fatigue

### Taper (Oct 15-31): MINIMAL
- **Frequency**: 1x/week, then stop 5 days before race
- **Intensity**: Light (60-70%)
- **Volume**: 2 sets, fewer exercises
- **Goal**: Muscle activation only

---

## Exercise Substitutions

*With your home gym (free weights + cables):*

| If You Don't Have... | Substitute |
|---------------------|------------|
| Barbell | Goblet squat (heavy DB) or Trap bar |
| Leg Press | Front squat or Belt squat |
| Lat Pulldown | Pull-ups or Cable pulldowns |
| Hip Thrust Machine | Barbell hip thrust on bench |

---

## Recovery Guidelines

### Post-Strength Nutrition
- **Within 30 min**: 20-30g protein + carbs
- **Before bed**: Casein or Greek yogurt (slow protein)

### Sleep
- 7-9 hours minimum
- Strength adaptation happens during sleep

### Signs of Overtraining
- Persistent heavy legs
- Declining performance on runs
- Poor sleep, elevated resting HR
- **Action**: Drop to 1x/week strength, add rest day
